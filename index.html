    Analyzed and optimized several SQL queries to drastically improve 
    the performance of previously long-running requests which were 
    negatively impacting the user experience.

    Led the move toward Redux in a React application which was lacking 
    proper state management, resulting in a significant reduction of 
    Time to Interactive (TTI) for key features. 
    
    Implemented a many-to-one path-finding algorithm for predicting 
    the ETA of proposed vessels to a given location.

    Developed, maintained and deployed several ETL services running on 
    AWS Lambda in a Python runtime.

    ------------------------------------------------------------------

    Hired to do research and development for a greenfield project, 
    building interactive one-way screen-sharing for customer service 
    agents without the need for browser plugins.

    Implemented a client-side application which performed asynchronous 
    and continuous DOM and resource serialization in TypeScript, while 
    being mindful of Cross-Site Scripting and Cross-Site Request 
    Forgery attack vectors.

    Levereged an existing technology stack within the company by 
    serving the API as a Java REST server on top of Google App Engine, 
    Google Cloud Storage, and Google Cloud Datastore.

    ------------------------------------------------------------------

    Performed code-reviews and managed deployments of customer-
    tracking JavaScript which was deployed at scale to several 
    international e-commerce retailers.

    Developed and maintained third-party integrations for a dozen 
    major marketing service providers.

    Delivered a 5x reduction in time to deploy third-party code by 
    extracting it from the main repository and separating the build 
    processes.
